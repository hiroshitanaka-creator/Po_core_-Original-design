# **Reason Log — Module README (v0.4)**

This folder contains design documents for recording, managing, and analyzing the reasoning process.

## Overview

The Reason Log module records the Po_core reasoning process in detail to ensure traceability and explainability. By making the basis of AI decisions explicit, it supports reliable systems.

## Key Components

### Po_core_Reason_Log (Core)

Basic recording of reasoning steps

- Per-step records
- Timestamp management
- Causal linkage preservation

### Advanced Completion Module

Fills in missing reasoning steps

- Makes implicit reasoning explicit
- Automatically detects gaps
- Generates completion candidates

### Classification Table

Structures and classifies logs

- Categorizes reasoning types
- Ranks importance
- Builds search indices

## Log Structure

### Basic Info

- Timestamp
- Reasoning step ID
- Parent–child links

### Reasoning Content

- Input data
- Applied “philosopher” (heuristic/approach)
- Intermediate results
- Final output

### Metadata

- Confidence score
- Tensors used
- Compute cost

## Usage Scenarios

### Debugging

- Trace the reasoning path
- Identify failure causes
- Find performance bottlenecks

### Explainability

- Generate user-facing explanations
- Show decision grounds
- Ensure transparency

### Analysis & Improvement

- Analyze reasoning patterns
- Surface improvement hints
- Support A/B testing

## Extended Features

### Advanced Completion

When the reasoning log has gaps, we complement it via:

1. **Pattern recognition:** infer from past similar cases
2. **Logical completion:** formal-logic inference
3. **Probabilistic inference:** statistical maximum-likelihood estimation

### Classification System

Logs are classified along these axes:

- **Reasoning type:** Deduction / Induction / Abduction
- **Philosophical lens:** “philosopher” applied
- **Importance:** Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Success / Failure:** outcome evaluation

## Document Set

- **Extended Definition:** details of Reason Log extensions
- **Advanced Completion Module Spec:** design & implementation of complement algorithms
- **Classification Table:** category definitions and rules

## Notable Characteristics

### Automatic Completion

Automatically complements missing steps and reconstructs a complete reasoning chain.

### Multi-layer Indices

Builds indices along multiple axes for efficient search.

### Real-time Recording

Writes logs in real time with minimal overhead.

## Implementation Notes

### Storage

- Large volumes likely accumulate
- Periodic archiving strategy required
- Balance compression and indexing

### Privacy

- May include personal information
- Apply appropriate masking
- Implement access control

### Performance

- Logging must not block core processing
- Use async writes
- Apply buffering appropriately
