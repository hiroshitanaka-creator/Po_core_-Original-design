# **Po_trace Evolution Ver.3 — Structural Template (with Semantic Classification & Responsibility Tracking)**

## **1. Overview**

This template evolves Po_trace to record, evaluate, and reflect semantic interventions, reconstructions, and series changes from the Viewer, API, and Po_self at a higher level of fidelity.

## **2. Extended `TraceEvent` Structure**

Advance the structure to include the locus of responsibility and semantic reason categories:

```python
class TraceEvent(BaseModel):
    event_type: EventType            # Enum: user_feedback / cluster_override / jump_escalated
    source: SourceType               # Enum: Viewer / API / Po_self
    actor_id: str                    # Identifier of the actor (e.g., viewer_1038)
    reason: ReasonType               # Enum: like, disagree_with_label, failed_jump, etc.
    impact_on_chain: ImpactType      # Enum: reclustered, tag_updated, priority_adjusted
    chain_id: str
    timestamp: datetime = Field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.utcnow())
```

## **3. Why Semantic Categories & Responsibility Matter**

- `actor_id` clarifies who made the decision.
- Classifying `reason` via Enum or meaning tensors forms a causal inference model that Po_self can learn from and adapt to.
- `impact_on_chain` provides a canonical evaluation of “structural change in meaning,” enabling downstream processing.

## **4. Separating Enum + `description()`**

Decouple display concerns from meaning-processing so Po_self can reason independently of UI:

```python
class ImpactType(str, Enum):
    reclustered = "reclustered"
    tag_updated = "profile_tag_updated"

    def description(self):
        if self == ImpactType.reclustered:
            return "The series structure was changed by a human."
        elif self == ImpactType.tag_updated:
            return "The persona label was overwritten."
```

## **5. Applications & Outlook**

With this, Po_trace becomes a mechanism that quantitatively and categorically records the history of narrative evolution, ethical evaluation, and structural responsibility for Po_self.
In the future, Po_self can learn actor-specific patterns (via `actor_id`) as a basis for personalized evolution models.
