Po_core_output serves as an “explainable structural tensor including validation evidence” and is ready for direct linkage with Po_responsibility_binder and Po_trace_logger.

Validation Method Information = {
 “Symbolic”: {
  "method_label": "✓ Rule-Based",
  "short": "This output was validated by comparing explicit logical forms and rule-based knowledge sources.",
  "technical": "Symbolic validation refers to methods that determine validity using formal rule structures, ontologies, or constraint checks (e.g., if A→B). This approach is fully traceable but limited to the scope of the rules.",
  "source_example": "NASA Ontology v3.1"
 },
 “Embedding”: {
  "method_label": "![🧠][image2] Vector Similarity",
  "short": "Validation was performed using vector similarity between the output and trusted documents.",
  "technical": "Embedding-based validation compares generated text to known sources in high-dimensional vector space. It is probabilistic and fast but may lack fine interpretability.",
  "source_example": "PubMed VectorSpace (2025-05)"
 },
 “Human Review”: {
  "method_label": "![👤][image3] Human Review",
  "short": "This result was checked and approved by a human evaluator.",
  "technical": "‘Human review’ indicates that an expert or user has manually checked the accuracy or ethical acceptability of the output. Provides high reliability but limited scalability and reproducibility.",
  "source_example": "Expert Panel Log #47 (Policy Review)"
 },
 “Hybrid”: {
  "method_label": "![🔀][image4] Hybrid Check",
  "short": "A combination of multiple validation methods was used to achieve a balance of accuracy and traceability.",
  "technical": "Hybrid validation integrates symbolic logic (high accuracy), embedding (coverage), and human input (contextual judgment) to maximize both correctness and interpretability.",

Linked Modules / Elements Used / Effects:

Po_ui_renderer: method_label – badge display / filtering / trust color coding

Po_trace_logger: source_example – citation recording → validation chain traceability

Po_self_recursor: short + source – determining source reuse during reconstruction

Po_feedback_logger: method_label – can be used for cross-evaluating user satisfaction and validation method
