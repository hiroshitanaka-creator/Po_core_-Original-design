Module Designs

This folder contains design documents for each functional module of Po_core.

📋 Overview

This folder includes detailed designs for the main modules that make up Po_core. Each module is structured so that it can be designed, implemented, and tested independently.

📂 Module Structure
output_rendering/

Responsible for output generation and rendering

Formatting inference results

Multi-format output

Template engine

reason_log/

Recording and management of the inference process

Logging inference steps

Log classification and search

Ensuring traceability

viewer/

Visualization and user interface

Visualization of inference processes

Display of pressure fields

Interactive exploration

po_trace/

Tracing functions and event logging

Tracking events

Recording causal relationships

Debugging support

🎯 Module Design Principles
Loose Coupling

Each module operates independently

Clearly defined interfaces

Minimization of dependencies

High Cohesion

Grouping related functions

Single responsibility principle

Clear boundaries

Extensibility

Plugin mechanism

Customizable design

Compatibility across versions

💡 Development Tips
Module Selection

Choose the appropriate module according to the function you wish to implement:

Output control → output_rendering/

Log management → reason_log/

UI development → viewer/

Debugging → po_trace/

Dependencies

Module dependencies are minimized, but some mutual dependencies exist. For details, refer to each module’s README.

Testing

Each module can be tested independently. Unit testing on a per-module basis is recommended.

🔧 Implementation Status

The implementation status of each module is as follows:
