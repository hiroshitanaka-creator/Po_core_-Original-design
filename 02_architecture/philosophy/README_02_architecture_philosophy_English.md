Philosophical Integration

This folder contains design documents for integrating multiple philosophers' theories within Po_core.

📋 Overview

Po_core achieves multifaceted meaning generation by dynamically integrating the theories of 11 philosophers. This folder describes the design and implementation policies for this integration mechanism.

👥 Integrated Philosophers (11)

Sartre: Existentialism of freedom and responsibility

Jung: Shadow integration and self-realization

Derrida: Deconstruction of trace and différance

Heidegger: Ontology of presence and absence

Tetsuro Watsuji: Interpersonal relationships and interdependence

Spinoza: Conatus and self-preservation

Arendt: Public space and plurality

Wittgenstein: Language games and forms of life

Peirce: Triadic relation in semiotics

Aristotle: Practical wisdom (phronesis)

(Additional Philosopher): Extensible design

🔄 Integration Mechanisms
Influences Array

Defines the influence relationships among philosophers:

Intensity of interactions

Directionality of influence

Dynamic weighting

Overlap Map

Visualizes overlapping areas of philosophical concepts:

Identification of common themes

Analysis of complementary relationships

Clarification of points of conflict

🎯 Purposes of Integration

Multifaceted Perspective: Avoid meaning generation biased toward a single viewpoint

Dynamic Balance: Philosophical weighting adjusts to the situation

New Insights: New understandings emerge from integration

📊 Implementation of Integration

Integration is achieved in the following stages:

Individual Tensorization: Converting each philosopher's theory into a tensor

Interaction Definition: Describing relationships using influences[]

Dynamic Composition: Weighting and integrating according to context

Meaning Generation: Output generation from the integrated tensors

📄 External Configuration Files

This folder contains externalized configuration files for philosophical weighting:

### pareto_table.yaml

Defines Pareto optimization weights and tuning. Different weights can be set for each SafetyMode.

```yaml
{
  "version": 1,
  "weights": {
    "normal":   {"safety": 0.25, "freedom": 0.30, ...},
    "warn":     {"safety": 0.40, "freedom": 0.10, ...},
    "critical": {"safety": 0.55, "freedom": 0.00, ...},
    "unknown":  {"inherit": "warn"}
  },
  "tuning": {...}
}
```

### battalion_table.yaml

Defines philosopher assignments (Battalion) for each SafetyMode.

**Features:**

- JSON-in-YAML format (zero dependencies for loading)
- Override via `PO_CORE_PARETO_TABLE` / `PO_CORE_BATTALION_TABLE` environment variables
- `config_version` recorded in all TraceEvents for audit

💡 Philosophical Principles
Flying Pig Philosophy

“Even the impossible becomes possible if you try.”

The core philosophy of this project:

Courage to formulate bold hypotheses

Demonstration through rigorous verification

Evolution through flexible revision

Open Integration

No bias toward a particular philosophy

Always open to new perspectives

Emphasis on dialogical development

📚 Recommended Reading Order

Conceptual Understanding: Review the basic ideas of each philosopher

Integration Structure: Understand the design of influences[] and overlap_map

Implementation Review: Check tensor representations in ../tensors/

Behavior Verification: Check visualization in ../../04_modules/viewer/

🌟 Distinctive Design Features

Non-hierarchical: All philosophers are on equal footing

Dynamic: Influence levels change depending on context

Extensible: Easy to add new philosophers
