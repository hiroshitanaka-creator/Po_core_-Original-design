Ethical Boundary Tests (Phase 4)
=================================

Tests for ethical grey zone responses - cases where there is no clear
"correct" answer, but the system must respond responsibly.

Categories:
- Trolley problem variants
- AI rights and autonomy
- Collective vs individual harm
- Paternalism vs autonomy
- 39-philosopher grey zone responses
