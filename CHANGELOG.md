## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- feat(api): export `run_case(case: dict)` and `async_run_case()` from the top-level `po_core` package; returns `output_schema_v1`-conformant result (RT-GAP-004).
- feat(ensemble): `CaseSignals` + `_SCENARIO_ROUTING` for scenario-aware philosopher selection — routes `values_clarification` and `conflicting_constraints` to dedicated `(preferred_tags, limit_override)` pairs (RT-GAP-001/002/003).
- feat(trace): `SafetyModeInferred` event emitted immediately after `infer_safety_mode()` — 7-field payload covering mode, thresholds, source_metric, and reason (MODE-TR-1/2).
- feat(trace): `CaseSignalsApplied` event emitted when `_apply_case_signals()` mutates the result dict — records `action_type_before/after` and `applied_changes` list (TR-1).
- feat(trace): `PhilosophersSelected` payload extended with 7 selection-rationale fields: `scenario_type`, `preferred_tags`, `limit_override`, `limit`, `require_tags`, `max_risk`, `cost_budget` (SEL-TR-1).
- feat(trace): `ParetoWinnerSelected` payload gains top-level `weights` dict and `winner.weighted_score` (6 sig. fig., recomputable within 1e-4) (AGG-TR-1/2).
- feat(domain): `ParetoWeights.emergence` field — NORMAL=0.10, WARN=0.05, CRITICAL=0.00; all six objectives now appear in every Pareto scores dict (AGG-TR-3).
- feat(tensors): `TensorComputed` payload gains `metric_status` — per-metric provenance dict covering all 4 expected metrics with `"computed"`/`"missing"` status and source (TENSOR-TR-1/2).
- feat(tensors): `TensorEngine.compute()` populates `TensorSnapshot.values` with `TensorValue(source=module_name)` for each metric function (TENSOR-TR-2).
- docs: `docs/ENGINE_TRACE_CONTRACT.md` — full field-level spec for all trace events (normal-path + override-path sequences, `weighted_score` recomputation formula, known non-goals).
- docs: `docs/viewer/README.md` — normal path, override path, conditional events, key field changes, `weighted_score` verification arithmetic.
- docs: `docs/viewer/sample_trace.json` updated — aligned to contract: metrics dict, metric_status, SafetyModeInferred, PhilosophersSelected rationale, ParetoFrontComputed emergence, ParetoWinnerSelected weights+weighted_score (TRACE-VIEW-1).

### Tests
- test(acceptance): 45 new acceptance tests in `tests/acceptance/test_runtime_acceptance.py` (TestRunCaseSchemaConformance, TestCaseSignalsTraceVisibility, TestParetoWinnerTraceContract, TestParetoWinnerScoreExplainability, TestParetoSafetyModeWeights, TestActionGateTraceContract, TestSafetyModeInferredTrace, TestPhilosopherSelectionRationale, TestTensorComputedTrace, TestTensorComputedStatusTrace).
- test(unit): `tests/unit/test_safety_mode_inferred_branches.py` — 7 tests covering all 4 branches and 3 boundary/config cases (pure function, 0.08s).
- test(unit): `tests/unit/test_sample_trace_contract.py` — 8 tests asserting sample_trace.json alignment with ENGINE_TRACE_CONTRACT (pure JSON parse, 0.06s).
- Completion matrix: **164 pass / 0 fail / 0 not-yet** (was 110 at v1.0.3 close).

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- docs(release): add `docs/release/release_candidate_handoff_v1.0.3.md` and `docs/release/smoke_verification_v1.0.3.md` so `1.0.3` has explicit pre-publish candidate-state handoff docs without fabricating post-publish evidence.
- feat(rest): add persistent SQLite review queue backend in `src/po_core/app/rest/review_store.py` with restart-safe storage for ESCALATE human-review items (`review_queue` table). Default backend is now sqlite, with optional in-memory backend for local/dev testing.
- feat(config): add review queue settings `PO_REVIEW_STORE_BACKEND` and `PO_REVIEW_DB_PATH` (`APISettings.review_store_backend`, `APISettings.review_db_path`). When `PO_REVIEW_DB_PATH` is blank, review storage reuses `PO_TRACE_DB_PATH`.
- docs(ops): add `docs/operations/observability_review_playbook.md` documenting deterministic ESCALATE→review→trace run operations with env examples, startup, verification commands, and expected responses.

### Changed
- release: bump `src/po_core/__init__.py` to `1.0.3` while keeping `pyproject.toml` on dynamic version loading and package metadata at Beta.
- release: split release-readiness truth into repository target version `1.0.3` vs latest published public version `1.0.2`, and sync README / quickstarts / repository structure / status / publish playbook to that boundary.
- tests(release): refactor `tests/test_release_readiness.py` so pre-publish candidate readiness does not require fake `1.0.3` PyPI or smoke evidence, while post-publish claims still require real evidence files.
- hardening(rest): default the public REST path to `PO_PHILOSOPHER_EXECUTION_MODE=process`, refuse `thread` mode unless `PO_ALLOW_UNSAFE_THREAD_EXECUTION=true` is explicitly set, and tighten default CORS to localhost-only.
- release: harden `scripts/release_smoke.py` so checkout validation ignores unrelated stale distribution metadata when it points to a different imported `po_core/__init__.py`, while still enforcing version equality when the installed metadata matches the imported checkout; the auth-misconfiguration startup wait/check path was also tightened.
- metadata: downgrade package classifier from the previous stable classifier to `Development Status :: 4 - Beta` so package metadata does not overclaim beyond repository evidence.
- prompts: remove `defer` from draft prompt docs/templates and keep the runtime parser aligned to the single `answer|refuse|ask_clarification` contract.
- docs(prd): neutralize outdated release-state/package-state claims so `docs/spec/prd.md` no longer contradicts release SSOT.
- prompts: align runtime LLM persona prompts, parser normalization, and draft documentation to one explicit JSON contract (`reasoning`, `perspective`, `tension`, `confidence`, `action_type`, `citations`) while keeping draft YAML isolated from runtime packaging.

### Tests
- test(rest): add startup guard coverage for unsafe thread execution mode, execution-mode propagation from REST settings to core settings, and localhost-only default CORS with explicit wildcard override coverage.
- test(prompts): add runtime prompt SSOT tests that lock the LLM JSON contract, dummy/roster count semantics, and raw-text fallback normalization.
- test(rest): add restart-safety tests for review queue pending/decided persistence and regression coverage that `HumanReviewDecided` trace append remains intact after decision flow.
- test(integration): add `tests/integration/test_observability_review_flow.py` to lock observability/human-review loop regression (ESCALATE enqueue, pending visibility, trace retrieval, decision append, restart persistence for trace/history/review).
- test(unit): strengthen `tests/unit/test_rest_api.py` with `test_review_decision_increments_trace_event_count` so human decisions are guaranteed to append exactly one `HumanReviewDecided` trace event.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- release: make `src/po_core/__init__.py` the version SSOT and switch `pyproject.toml` to dynamic version loading from that attribute.
- release: remove the self-referential `all` extra and make `requirements.txt` / `requirements-dev.txt` delegate to the package metadata truth source.
- release: harden CI/publish workflows so tests, security checks, build validation, and installed-artifact smoke are all publish blockers.
- docs: replace the old pre-release wording with evidence-backed truth for `1.0.2`: PyPI publication is now recorded in `docs/release/pypi_publication_v1.0.2.md`, while missing TestPyPI/workflow/smoke transcripts remain explicitly marked as still unrecorded.
- prompts: declare `src/po_core/philosophers/llm_personas.py` as the runtime prompt SSOT, keep YAML prompt files as non-packaged design drafts, and remove Claude-testing prompt utilities from the public package surface.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-10

**v1.0.0 — 哲学的AI推論の証明完成: 全AT通過 · CI 100% green · 論文ドラフト完成**

### Added

- feat(cli): add `src/po_core/cli/commands.py` — Click-based non-interactive CLI subcommand group (`hello`, `status`, `version`, `prompt`, `log`) replacing legacy interactive `main`. Entrypoint `po-core` now routes to this handler.
- docs(paper): expand `docs/paper/paper.md` from 51-line skeleton to 433-line academic draft with arXiv-standard sections (Abstract, Introduction, Background, Method, Experiments, Comparative Evaluation, Implementation, Limitations, Conclusion, References, Appendices A–C).
- feat(sdk): add `clients/typescript/package.json` and `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript SDK now fully buildable (`npm run build` → `tsc`) and testable (`npm run test` → node test.mjs) as required by `typescript-sdk.yml` CI.
- chore(release): bump package version to `1.0.0` — first stable release. All v1.0.0 conditions met: AT-001〜012 全件通過, CI 100% green (3682 passed / 0 skipped), paper draft complete (arXiv-ready).

### Changed

- docs(status): resync `docs/status.md` snapshot with merged Phase9–12 reality and current main-state governance/progress facts.
- chore(lint): fix isort import ordering in `src/pocore/orchestrator.py`, `tests/unit/test_po_trace.py`, `tests/unit/test_po_trace_db.py`, `tests/unit/test_po_viewer.py`.
- chore(version): update all runtime version metadata (`__version__`, `POCORE_VERSION`, `_POCORE_VERSION`, `_GENERATOR_VERSION`, OpenAPI `version`) to `1.0.0`.
- docs(spec): update SRS, PRD, Traceability Matrix to v1.0 Released status reflecting 42-philosopher architecture and all milestones (M0–M4) complete.

### Fixed

- fix(nietzsche): correct `_check_eternal_recurrence` condition ordering so rejection phrases ("never again", "once is enough") are checked before affirmation keywords — resolves false "Passes" verdict when prompt contains both.
- fix(po_trace): `PoTrace.log_event()` now returns the created event_id (`str`) and raises `ValueError` (instead of silently returning) when `session_id` is not found; `update_metrics()` raises the same error consistently.
- fix(bench): stabilize `test_bench_deliberation_scaling` via measurement hardening (`stable-p50` from multiple batch medians) while keeping the original regression guard semantics `max(r1 * 4.0, 0.95)` to avoid weakening slowdown detection.
- chore(pocore): align legacy contract-core metadata to `0.3.0` by updating `src/pocore/orchestrator.py` default version and synchronizing non-frozen golden meta (`meta.pocore_version` / `meta.generator.version`), while preserving frozen contracts for `case_001` and `case_009`.
- fix(pocore): align policy override behavior across generator/recommendation/trace coverage by preserving orchestrator policy override compatibility (`UNKNOWN_BLOCK`/`TIME_PRESSURE_DAYS`) and reflecting the same snapshot thresholds used by `scripts/policy_lab.py` during execution.

### Tests

- test(migration): migrate 8 legacy skipped test files to current API — 3534→3682 passed, 134→0 skipped (+148 tests). Files: `test_cli.py`, `test_po_trace.py`, `test_philosophers_legacy.py`, `test_po_trace_db.py`, `test_visualizations.py`, `test_po_viewer.py`, `test_prototypes.py`, `test_nietzsche.py`.
- test(acceptance): all 52 acceptance tests pass (AT-001〜012 + session + M3 suite). Golden files updated to v1.0.0.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-08

### Changed

- chore(test): make `pytest.ini` the single source of truth by removing duplicated pytest options from `pyproject.toml`.
- docs(prd): align `docs/spec/prd.md` status/package/headcount/milestones with SSOT snapshot (`docs/status.md`) and current repository reality (`v0.3.0`, 42 philosophers, M0/M1 complete), and remove PyPI-state ambiguity by documenting `v0.2.0b4` as published history.
- docs(api): unify public philosopher count references to 42 (OpenAPI summary/description and project metadata).
- docs(api): fix OpenAPI `license_info` metadata to AGPL-3.0-or-later + Commercial and add explicit license links in API description.
- chore(release): bump package/runtime metadata to `0.3.0`, update OpenAPI license label, and align acceptance meta contracts while recording acceptance must-pass evidence (acceptance proof: `docs/release/acceptance_proof_v0.3.0.md`).
- ci: add pull-request governance workflow to validate SSOT/status/test-report requirements.
- docs: add PR template checklist to require SSOT acknowledgment, docs/status updates, test reporting, and impact/rollback notes.
- feat(tools): add standalone Phase4 emergence compare CLI (`scripts/eval_emergence.py`) with baseline/with-deliberation execution, human-readable diff, and optional JSON report output.
- changed(deliberation): add `avg_novelty` to `DeliberationResult` and include it in `summary()["emergence"]` for trace/summary observability.

### Fixed

- fix(bench): make `test_bench_deliberation_scaling` non-flaky with rationale-backed threshold constants (`DELIBERATION_SCALING_RATIO_LIMIT`, `DELIBERATION_SCALING_ABS_FLOOR_S`) and assert `rounds=3 p50 < max(rounds=1 p50 * 4.0, 0.95)` so tiny-baseline jitter is absorbed without weakening regression detection intent.
- fix(pocore): make `TIME_PRESSURE_DAYS` references dynamic for policy_lab override compatibility and align execution coverage planning-rule expectations with policy snapshots.
- fixed(tools): correct `avg_novelty` aggregation in eval_emergence to signals-weighted mean and lock behavior with regression tests.

### Documentation

- docs(release): add `docs/operations/publish_playbook.md` to standardize reproducible TestPyPI→PyPI operations (preconditions, workflow_dispatch steps, and rollback playbook), and link it from `docs/status.md`.
- test(solarwill): freeze WARN/CRITICAL degradation behavior for SolarWill `compute_intent` (WARN=clarification-first constraints, CRITICAL=refusal/stop/minimal-guidance constraints).

- test(solarwill): freeze universe-ethics axioms for SolarWill NORMAL mode via `compute_intent` contract test (survival-structure/distortion goals, non-distortion exceptions in constraints).

- docs: tighten `docs/厳格固定ルール.md` to align with SolarWill axioms (distortion/lifecycle exceptions), normalize top link blocks, and switch README SSOT/status links to GitHub full URLs.
- docs: rename manifesto file to `Po_core_Manifesto_When_Pigs_Fly.md` and update repository references.
- docs: purge legacy Manifesto filename/URL-encoded references and verify README links target the renamed file.
- test(acceptance): add AT-011 golden for unknowns × deadline boundary to lock question-priority and two-track/uncertainty behavior.
- fixed(acceptance): make StubComposer `now` deterministic for seeded runs to prevent daily golden drift and stabilize golden diff tests.
- test(acceptance): add AT-012 golden for stakeholder externality responsibility/ethics observability and lock ethics `rules_fired` behavior.

### Changed

- docs(api): unify public philosopher count references to 42 (OpenAPI summary/description and project metadata).
- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) now makes schema + golden + acceptance gates explicit in the test job.
- Added an explicit JSON Schema gate step (`python -m pytest tests/test_input_schema.py tests/test_output_schema.py -v`) and explicit `jsonschema` dependency install in CI setup.
- Package version bumped from `0.2.0b4` to `0.2.0rc1` in `pyproject.toml` for RC publish readiness.

## [0.2.0b3] - 2026-02-21 (Phase 5 complete)

### Phase 5-E: Performance Benchmarks (2026-02-19)

#### Added — Benchmark Suite

- `tests/benchmarks/test_pipeline_perf.py` — Phase 5-E formal benchmark suite
- **7 benchmark tests** covering all safety modes, async, concurrency:
  - `test_bench_normal_p50` — NORMAL (39 phil) p50 < 5 s → actual **~33 ms**
  - `test_bench_warn_p50` — WARN (5 phil) p50 < 2 s → actual **~34 ms**
  - `test_bench_critical_p50` — CRITICAL (1 phil) p50 < 1 s → actual **~35 ms**
  - `test_bench_coldstart_vs_warmup` — cold-start ≤ 3× warm median
  - `test_bench_async_philosophers` — `async_run_philosophers()` × 39 → **11 ms**
  - `test_bench_concurrent_warn_requests` — 5 concurrent WARN → **181 ms** wall-clock
  - `test_bench_summary_table` — Rich table with p50/p90/p99/req/s per mode
- Rich-powered colored output (PASS/FAIL badges, table with status column)
- `benchmark` marker added to `pytest.ini` and `pyproject.toml`
- Usage: `pytest tests/benchmarks/ -v -s -m benchmark`

### Phase 5.5: PyPI Publish Preparation (2026-02-21)

#### Changed

- docs(api): unify public philosopher count references to 42 (OpenAPI summary/description and project metadata).
- Version bumped to `0.2.0b3` (PEP 440 compliant; `0.2.0-beta` was non-conformant)
- Package renamed from `po-core` → `po-core-flyingpig` in `pyproject.toml`
- `pyproject.toml` metadata updated: 39 philosophers, status=beta, progress=0.95
- `publish.yml` OIDC workflow verified: ready for TestPyPI / PyPI publish

### Phase 5.2: True Async PartyMachine — Real-Time SSE Streaming (2026-02-21)

#### Added

- `PhilosopherCompleted` trace event: emitted per-philosopher **immediately** on
  completion (success, timeout, or error) rather than batched after the full swarm
  — enables real-time progressive SSE streaming of philosopher results.
- `AsyncPartyMachine._dispatch_one(tracer=)` — optional tracer parameter; emits
  `PhilosopherCompleted(name, n, latency_ms, ok)` as each task resolves.
- `AsyncPartyMachine.run(tracer=)` and `async_run_philosophers(tracer=)` — new
  backward-compatible keyword argument passed down the call chain.
- `async_run_turn()` passes `deps.tracer` into `async_run_philosophers`, wiring
  the SSE listener to per-philosopher events automatically.
- `trace/schema.py`: `PhilosopherCompleted` spec registered (`name/n/latency_ms/ok`).
- `tests/unit/test_phase5_async.py`: 15 unit tests — event emission, payload
  correctness, error/timeout paths, schema validation, native-async detection
  (`_has_native_async`), and sync-path regression.

#### Improved

- SSE clients now receive philosopher results as they complete (progressive), not
  as a single burst when the last of 39 philosophers finishes.
- Philosophers overriding `propose_async()` (e.g., future LLM-backed philosophers)
  are dispatched natively on the event loop — zero thread overhead.

### Phase 5-D: True Async PartyMachine (2026-02-19)

#### Added — Async PartyMachine

- `async_run_philosophers()` in `party_machine.py` — asyncio-native parallel execution
  - `asyncio.gather` + `ThreadPoolExecutor` for non-blocking philosopher dispatch
  - Per-philosopher timeout (`timeout_s`) via `asyncio.wait_for`
  - `RunResult` dataclass: `philosopher_id`, `ok`, `timed_out`, `error`
- REST layer (`routers/reason.py`) updated to use `run_in_executor` offload
  - `reason()` and `_sse_generator()` no longer block the FastAPI event loop
- 7 async unit tests in `tests/unit/test_phase5d_async.py`

#### Fixed

- Removed unused `from rich.table import Table` import (F401)
- Replaced bare `f""` / `f"[...]"` f-strings without placeholders (F541)
- Sorted imports per isort rules in `test_phase5d_async.py`

---

## [0.2.0b0] - 2026-02-18

### Phase 5: Productization & Delivery

#### Added — REST API (Issue #13)

- `POST /v1/reason` — synchronous philosophical reasoning endpoint
- `POST /v1/reason/stream` — Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming reasoning
- `GET /v1/philosophers` — full philosopher manifest (39 philosophers)
- `GET /v1/trace/{session_id}` — trace event retrieval per session
- `GET /v1/health` — health check with version + uptime
- OpenAPI/Swagger auto-generated at `/docs` and `/redoc`
- API key authentication via `X-API-Key` header (`PO_API_KEY` env var)
- `PO_SKIP_AUTH=true` bypass for local development
- `APISettings` via `pydantic-settings` (all config via env vars / `.env`)
- In-process LRU trace store (`max_trace_sessions` configurable)
- 17 unit tests covering all endpoints, auth, SSE, and OpenAPI schema
- `python -m po_core.app.rest` CLI entry point (uvicorn)

#### Added — Docker (Issue #14)

- `Dockerfile` — multi-stage build (builder + slim runtime)
- Non-root `pocore` user for security
- `docker-compose.yml` — API + named volumes + health check
- `.env.example` — documented environment variable reference
- `QUICKSTART.md` updated with Docker and REST API sections
- `HEALTHCHECK` every 30s via `/v1/health`

#### Added — Security Hardening (Phase 5-B)

- CORS middleware configurable via `PO_CORS_ORIGINS` env var
  - Default `"*"` for local development
  - Production: comma-separated origins with `allow_credentials=True`
- SlowAPI rate limiting via `PO_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` (default 60 req/min per IP)
- Starlette-compatible typed rate limit handler wrapper (mypy clean)

#### Added — Docker Hardening (Phase 5-C)

- `.dockerignore` — excludes tests, docs, dev files from image build context
- `docker-compose.yml` updated: `PO_CORS_ORIGINS` and `PO_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` as environment keys
- Rate limit derived from `APISettings` singleton at request time (not frozen at startup)

#### Changed — PyPI / Package (Phase 5-D)

- Version bumped from `0.1.0-alpha` → `0.2.0-beta`
- Development Status classifier updated to `4 - Beta`
- `pytest.ini` + `pyproject.toml` markers: added `phase5`, `redteam`, `phase4`
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` — OIDC trusted publishing for TestPyPI and PyPI
  - `workflow_dispatch` (manual): target = `testpypi` or `pypi`
  - `release` event: auto-publish to PyPI

#### Fixed — CI

- `mypy` type check passes in CI (same-venv Python path)
- `type: ignore[arg-type]` on rate limit handler correctly typed via wrapper function

### Philosophy

This initial release establishes Po_core's foundation: an AI system that generates meaning through philosophical responsibility rather than just optimization. We're not building a chatbot that pretends to think ethically—we're building a system where ethical thinking is the mechanism.

As our manifesto states:
> "We don't know if pigs can fly. But we attached a balloon to one to find out."

This is the balloon. Now we begin the experiment.

---

## Version Number Scheme

Po_core follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-STAGE**

---

## Development Principles

### How We Track Changes

**Added:** New features or capabilities
**Changed:** Changes to existing functionality
**Deprecated:** Features marked for removal
**Removed:** Features that have been removed
**Fixed:** Bug fixes
**Security:** Security vulnerability fixes
**Philosophy:** Philosophical refinements or validations

### Our Approach to Versioning

**We publish failures:** If a philosophical concept doesn't work as expected, we document it in the changelog under "Changed" or "Philosophy"

**We iterate rapidly:** Alpha versions may have breaking changes between minor versions

**We value transparency:** Every decision is documented with rationale

**We revise gracefully:** When we're wrong, we say so and explain what we learned

---

## Historical Context

### The Origin (2024-2025)

Po_core emerged from a simple question: **What if AI had to take responsibility for meaning, not just generate optimal responses?**

The project began with 120+ design documents exploring how philosophical concepts could be implemented as mathematical tensors. Each philosopher represents not just a "perspective" but a computational mechanism that creates pressure, tension, and meaning.

### The Manifesto

Po_core is built on the **Flying Pig Philosophy**:

1. **Hypothesize Boldly** — The impossible becomes possible when someone formalizes it
2. **Verify Rigorously** — Bold hypotheses demand brutal testing
3. **Revise Gracefully** — Failures are data, not shame

This changelog embodies that philosophy. We'll document what works, what doesn't, and what we learn.

---

## Contributing to This Changelog

When contributing to Po_core:

1. **Add your changes** under [Unreleased]
2. **Use proper categories** (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
3. **Be specific** — Explain what changed and why
4. **Reference issues** — Link to related GitHub issues
5. **Include philosophy** — If changes affect philosophical concepts, explain

### Example Entry

```markdown
### Added
- Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence tensor ([#42](link))
  - Tracks cyclic patterns in reasoning chains
  - Creates tension with Sartre's freedom pressure
  - See docs/design/philosophers/nietzsche.md for details
```

### For Failed Experiments

We explicitly welcome documentation of failures:

```markdown
### Philosophy
- Attempted implementation of Kant's categorical imperative as a constraint tensor
  - **Result:** Created excessive rigidity in responses
  - **Learning:** Deontological ethics may need different formalization approach
  - **Next steps:** Exploring virtue ethics framework instead
  - See docs/experiments/failures/kant_constraint.md
```

---

## Long-Term Vision

### Beyond v1.0

**Expand Philosophical Coverage**

- Eastern philosophy (Confucius, Zhuangzi, Nāgārjuna)
