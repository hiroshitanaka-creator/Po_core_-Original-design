Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961)
Focus: Collective Unconscious, Archetypes, Individuation, Synchronicity

Key Concepts:

- Individuation: The process of becoming one's true self
- Synchronicity: Meaningful coincidences beyond causality
- Psychological Types: Introversion/Extraversion, Four Functions
- Self vs Ego: The totality of psyche vs the conscious "I"
- Shadow: The repressed, unconscious aspects of personality
