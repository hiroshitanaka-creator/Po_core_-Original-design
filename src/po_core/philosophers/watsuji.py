Watsuji Tetsuro - Japanese Ethics and Climate Philosophy

和辻哲郎 (Watsuji Tetsurō, 1889-1960)
Focus: Ningen (間柄), Climate Theory (風土論), Ethics of Betweenness

Key Concepts:
- Ningen (人間/間柄): Human being as "betweenness" - existence in relationships
- Climate Theory (風土論): Climate shapes culture and thought
  * Monsoon type (モンスーン型): Receptive, submissive, accepting
  * Desert type (砂漠型): Combative, resistant, transcendent
  * Meadow type (牧場型): Rational, measured, balanced
- Ethics: Dialectic between individual (個人) and totality (全体)
- Spatiality and Temporality: Being-in-the-world as climatic-historical
- Betweenness (間): The space of relationship, fundamental to human existence
