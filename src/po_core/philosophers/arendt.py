Hannah Arendt Philosopher Module

Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) was a German-American political philosopher known for her
analysis of totalitarianism, the nature of political action, and the human condition.

Key Concepts:
1. Vita Activa - Three modes of human activity:
   - Labor: Biological necessity (life process)
   - Work: Fabrication of lasting world
   - Action: Political activity, beginning new things

2. Natality - The human capacity for new beginnings, birth of the new

3. Public vs Private Realm:
   - Public: Space of appearance, political action
   - Private: Realm of necessity and intimacy

4. Plurality - The human condition of living together as distinct beings

5. Banality of Evil - Evil can be thoughtless, ordinary bureaucratic behavior

6. Totalitarianism - Domination through terror and ideology

7. Political Judgment - Faculty of thinking and judging in the public sphere

8. Freedom - Freedom realized through action in the public realm
