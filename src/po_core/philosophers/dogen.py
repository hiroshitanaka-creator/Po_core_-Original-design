Dogen Zenji Philosopher Module

Dogen Zenji (道元禅師, 1200-1253) was a Japanese Zen Buddhist monk, philosopher,
and founder of the Soto school of Zen in Japan. His philosophy centers on the
unity of practice and enlightenment, the nature of time and being, and the
direct realization of Buddha-nature.

Key Concepts:

1. Being-Time (有時/Uji) - Time and existence are identical; all existence is time,
   all time is existence. Past, present, and future interpenetrate.

2. Buddha-Nature (仏性) - All beings have Buddha-nature; more radically, all beings
   ARE Buddha-nature. Even grasses, trees, and tiles possess Buddha-nature.

3. Shikantaza (只管打坐) - "Just sitting" - zazen without object, goal, or
   expectation. Pure practice for its own sake.

4. Practice-Enlightenment Unity (修証一如) - Practice is not a means to enlightenment;
   practice IS enlightenment. Original enlightenment (hongaku) manifests in practice.

5. Genjo Koan (現成公案) - "Actualizing the fundamental point" - reality as it is,
   the koan of everyday life, manifestation of truth in the present moment.

6. Dropping Body and Mind (身心脱落) - Non-dual realization where subject-object
   distinction falls away. Complete letting go of attachment to self.

7. Mountains and Waters Sutra (山水経) - Nature itself is Buddha's teaching;
   mountains walk, waters preach the dharma. The natural world as sacred text.

8. Impermanence (無常) - Radical impermanence; everything flows, nothing is fixed.
   Impermanence itself is Buddha-nature.

9. Non-Thinking (非思量) - Beyond thinking (思量) and not-thinking (不思量).
   The consciousness of zazen that transcends dualistic thought.

10. Zazen as Buddha - Sitting meditation is not a means to become Buddha;
    sitting itself is the manifestation of Buddha. The practice is the realization.
