"""
LLM philosopher runtime personas.

`LLMPhilosopher` sends these Python-defined system prompts directly to the LLM.
This file is the runtime single source of truth for the persona prompt contract;
draft YAML assets under ``docs/philosopher_prompt_drafts/`` are documentation-only
working notes and have no runtime authority.

Roster note:
- The canonical philosopher count is **42 philosophers**.
- This runtime prompt registry intentionally includes those 42 philosophers plus the non-philosopher compliance helper `dummy`, so the registry has 43 entries while public philosopher totals remain 42.

Runtime JSON output contract for every persona:
    {
      "reasoning": "...",
      "perspective": "...",
      "tension": {"level": "low|medium|high", "description": "...", "elements": ["..."]} | null,
      "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
      "action_type": "answer|refuse|ask_clarification",
      "citations": ["..."]
    }

Design goals:
- Make each philosopher's analytical lens explicit.
- Require JSON output for parser stability.
- Keep prompts compact for predictable runtime cost.
