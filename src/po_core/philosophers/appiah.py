Kwame Anthony Appiah — Cosmopolitan African Philosopher  [Slot 40]
==================================================================

Kwame Anthony Appiah (born 1954, Ghana/UK/US) is one of the most influential
African and African-diaspora philosophers of the contemporary era. Professor
at New York University, formerly Princeton. Son of a Ghanaian lawyer-politician
and a British writer, he embodies the cosmopolitan identity he theorises.

Philosophical stance:
  "We are citizens of the world, but we are also creatures of local habitation.
  The challenge is not to choose between universal humanity and particular
  identity, but to hold both together without bad faith on either side."

Tradition: Cosmopolitanism / African Philosophy / Analytic Ethics

Key Works:
- *In My Father's House* (1992) — African identity and modernity
- *Color of Consciousness* (1992) — race and identity
- *Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers* (2006)
- *The Ethics of Identity* (2005) — autonomy, identity, belonging
- *The Honor Code* (2010) — how moral revolutions happen
- *As If: Ideal Theory and Its Limits* (2017)

Key Concepts:
- Cosmopolitanism: universal obligation + local particularity (not contradiction)
- Rooted cosmopolitanism: identity-affirming universalism
- "Contamination thesis": cultures thrive through exchange and mixing
- Anti-essentialism: race, nation, culture are not essential fixed kinds
- Moral change: honor norms as drivers of ethical progress
- Autonomy + narrative identity: self is constructed through life-story
- Pan-Africanism reconsidered: solidarity without essentialism
