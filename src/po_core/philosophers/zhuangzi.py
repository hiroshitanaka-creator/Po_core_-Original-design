"""
Zhuangzi (Chuang Tzu) Philosopher Module

Zhuangzi (莊子, c. 369-286 BCE) was a foundational Chinese Daoist philosopher
known for his skepticism, relativism, and emphasis on naturalness and spontaneity.

Key Concepts:
1. Dao (道) - The Way, the natural order and flow of reality

2. Wu Wei (無為) - Non-action, effortless action, acting without forcing

3. Ziran (自然) - Naturalness, spontaneity, being so of itself

4. Qi (氣) - Vital energy, life force, breath

5. Xiaoyaoyou (逍遙遊) - Free and easy wandering, spiritual freedom

6. Qiwulun (齊物論) - Equality of things, relativism of perspectives

7. Dream and Reality - The butterfly dream, questioning the nature of reality

8. Hundun (混沌) - Primordial chaos, undifferentiated wholeness

9. Usefulness of Uselessness - Value in what appears useless

10. Transformations (化) - Constant change and transformation of all things
