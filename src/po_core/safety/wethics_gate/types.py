"""
W_ethics Gate Type Definitions
==============================

Core data structures for the W_ethics Gate system.

This module defines:
- Evidence: Raw signal from violation detector
- Violation: Aggregated violation from multiple evidence pieces
- GateConfig: Gate configuration with thresholds
- GateDecision: Enum for gate outcomes (ALLOW, ALLOW_WITH_REPAIR, REJECT, ESCALATE)
- GateResult: Complete gate evaluation result
- Candidate: Evaluation target with scores and metadata
- AxisScore: Per-axis evaluation with evidence and confidence
- SelectionResult: Candidate selection outcome

Design Notes:
- Evidence is the raw signal from detectors (can have multiple per violation)
- Violations are aggregated from evidence using probabilistic OR
- semantic_drift is checked after repairs to detect goal changes
